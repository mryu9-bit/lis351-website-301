    <!-- FEATURED CONTENT (HISTORY) -->
    <section id="history">
      <h2>History of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h2>
      <p>
        Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) originated in the early 20th century when Japanese judoka Mitsuyo Maeda taught
        judo techniques in Brazil. His teachings were adapted and refined by Hélio Gracie and the Gracie family,
        who emphasized leverage and technique over strength. BJJ later gained worldwide recognition through mixed
        martial arts competitions, especially the UFC, where it proved effective against larger opponents.

      <section id="gi-nogi">
        <h3>Gi vs No-Gi</h3>
        <p>
          Gi training uses a traditional uniform and focuses on grip-based techniques. No-Gi training does not use
          the uniform and is often faster-paced, with techniques commonly used in MMA training.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gi:</strong> More grips, slower pace, detailed control.</li>
          <li><strong>No-Gi:</strong> Faster pace, fewer grips, common for MMA-style grappling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Belt System</h3>
        <p>
          Students progress through belt ranks from white belt to black belt, representing their improvement in
          skill, knowledge, and experience.
